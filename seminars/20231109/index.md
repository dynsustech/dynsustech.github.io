Title: Multiple recurrence with weights

Abstract: We will discuss convergence of multiple ergodic averages with certain weights. In particular, we will study how one can extend a multiple recurrence result to a Wiener-Wintner or return times type result. We will briefly survey some of the developments regarding this area of study, as well as some of the techniques used to study convergence of these averages.
