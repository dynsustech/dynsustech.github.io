# SUSTech Dynamics

Here at [SUSTech](https://www.sustech.edu.cn/), we have a strong and active group working in several disciplines related to the theory of Dynamical Systems, including Ergodic Theory, Partially Hyperbolic Dynamics and Symplectic Dynamics. At present, we have 4 professors (Jana Hertz, Raul Ures, Pedro Salom√£o and Yiwei Zhang), working with Postdocs, visiting scholars, PhD. students, Master students and undergraduates. We hold [seminars](https://dynsustech.github.io/seminars/) regularly, inviting mathematicians from all over the world.
